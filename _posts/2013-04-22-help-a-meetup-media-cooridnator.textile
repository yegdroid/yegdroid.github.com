  Do you have aspirations to be the next Media Super Awesome Person? Do you have the first Tuesday of every month free? Do you want <strong>complete</strong> creative control in a no-fail environment? Well then, I have a non-paying, kudo generous position for you!

  I desperately need someone to help me with yegdroidgs (and GDG Edmonton) youtube/G+ hangout on air. Right now I'm using my macbook's webcam and mic and the quality is far from awesome. So, if you want to help out please let me know.

  If you are interested please contact me at chris@yegdroid.ca.

  Did I mention this is a no fail position?
