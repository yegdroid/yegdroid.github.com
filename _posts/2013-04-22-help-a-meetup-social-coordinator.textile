  Want some "Social Coordinating"" Experience? After a couple of hours a month to spare? I'm looking for a social coordiantor for yegdroid to help make sure that the pub we go has space, people know where to go,etc. This is a no fail position (can't be any worse that how I do it). What do you get in return? Well karma awesome-ness, linked-in kudos, mentions on this super high traffic site and an at least one round of applause from meetup members.

  If you are interested please contact me at chris@yegdroid.ca.
